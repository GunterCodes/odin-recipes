          <p>Mr. Jack Johnson cherished this breakfast dish so much, he created a hit song about it. Nothing starts an easy weekend morning off quite like a warm stack of pancakes with butter. Of course, these aren't ordinary pancakes, they're <strong>banana pancakes</strong>!</p>
          <p>We both know that you have over-ripe bananas sitting on your counter and frankly, you have no idea what to do with them. Fear not, for this recipe is here to rescue you from hunger and your spotty fruit from the trash.</p>
          <p>This recipe will yield approximately 12 pancakes or enough for about 6 servings!</p>
          <p>For this recipe, you will need the following items/tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bowl</li>
            <li>Measuring Cups/Spoons</li>
            <li>Wooden Spoon or Whisk</li>
            <li>Griddle or Frying Pan</li>
            <li>Spatula</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the tools listed above, you will need the following ingredients for this recipe:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1 Whole Egg</li>
            <li>1 cup Milk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Neutral Cooking Oil (vegetable/canola)</li>
            <li>2 Ripened Bananas</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a bowl and mix until combined. In a separate bowl, combine your egg, milk, oil, and bananas and mix until it resembles a loose batter.</li>
            <li>Pour the flour mixture into the banana mixture and stir to incorporate. Be sure to not over mix, you are just trying to hydrate the flour. Once mixed, let the batter rest on the counter for 10 minutes.</li>
            <p>NOTE: Now would be a good time to prepare your toppings if desired. <br>ex: sliced bananas, warmed syrup, peanut butter, etc.</p>
            <li>While the batter rests, heat your cooking surface over medium-high heat. Although the pancakes have oil, it may help to lightly oil the griddle to prevent sticking.</li>
            <p>TIP: Warm an oven to the lowest setting to have a good place to keep the pancakes hot while you cook them all.</p>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the cooking surface (~1/4 cup per pancake) and cook until golden brown (3-5 minutes per side).</li>
            <p>TIP: You can tell if the pancakes are ready to flip when you see bubbles forming all over the surface.</p>
            <li>Enjoy! (preferably with some coffee, an open window, and a good breeze)</li>
          </ol>
