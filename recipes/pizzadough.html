          <p>Pizza is the quintessential weekend meal - quick, cheap, and delicious. There is no need to go out and pay an overinflated amount of money for something that can be made with ingredients you probably have lying around your pantry.</p>
          <p>This recipe requires very little dough-know-how and energy to create. The most challenging step is mixing the dough (and even that is pretty easy!).</p>
          <p>For this recipe, you will need the following items/tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bowl</li>
            <li>Scale or Measuring Cups/Spoons</li>
            <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
            <li>Plastic Wrap or Cloth Towel</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the tools listed above, you will need the following ingredients for this recipe:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>3 cups (360g) All-Purpose Flour OR Bread Flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tsp (8g) Salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp (7g) Instant Yeast OR Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup (198 to 215g) Lukewarm Water (~100F)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp (25g) Olive Oil</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>If you're using active dry yeast, dissolve the yeast in 2 tablespoons of the measured lukewarm water with a pinch of sugar. Allow this mixture to sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it is bubbled and fragrant. If you are using instant yeast, you can skip this step.</li>
