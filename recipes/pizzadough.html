          <p>Pizza is the quintessential weekend meal - quick, cheap, and delicious. There is no need to go out and pay an overinflated amount of money for something that can be made with ingredients you probably have lying around your pantry.</p>
          <p>This recipe requires very little dough-know-how and energy to create. The most challenging step is mixing the dough (and even that is pretty easy!).</p>
          <p>For this recipe, you will need the following items/tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bowl</li>
            <li>Scale or Measuring Cups/Spoons</li>
            <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
            <li>Plastic Wrap or Cloth Towel</li>
            <li>Kitchen Timer</li>
            <li>Baking Sheet</li>
            <li>Cutting Board</li>
            <li>Pizza Wheel or Knife or Kitchen Scissors</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the tools listed above, you will need the following ingredients for this recipe:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>3 cups (360g) All-Purpose Flour OR Bread Flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tsp (8g) Salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp (7g) Instant Yeast OR Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup (198 to 215g) Lukewarm Water (~100F)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp (25g) Olive Oil</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>If you're using active dry yeast, dissolve the yeast in 2 tablespoons of the measured lukewarm water with a pinch of sugar. Allow this mixture to sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it is bubbled and fragrant. If you are using instant yeast, you can skip this step.</li>
            <li>Weigh the salt or measure it and place it into the empty bowl. Then, add the water and dissolve the salt into the water. This steps helps provide for an even distribution of salt, allowing a better rise of the dough.</li>
            <li>To the salt and water mixture, add the flour and the dissolved yeast mixture (or instant yeast) and mix everything together with the spoon. You are looking for the dough to come together in a shaggy form. It does not have to be perfect at this stage. Once the dough comes together, scrape the dough off the spoon and loosely cover the dough with plastic wrap or drape it with a moist towel. Set a timer for 20 minutes and let the dough rest. <br></li>
            <p>NOTE: Now would be a good time to prepare your ingredients (chop veges, shred cheese, make sauce, etc!)</p>
            <li>After the 20 minute rest, empty the dough out onto a clean counter and knead for 4 to 5 minutes. The dough should smooth out, become less tacky, and start developing some strength. After kneading, place the dough into an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Place the bowl in the warmest area of your house (turned off oven with the light turned on works well) and leave it for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <p>NOTE: Once kneaded, the dough can stay in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The longer you let the dough <em>cold ferment</em>, the better the final flavor will be. </p>
            <li>After rising, turn the dough out onto your work surface while making sure to preserve as much air as possible. Divide the dough in half to make two 14" round pizzas.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to the hottest possible temperature (usually 500F). To prepare the dough, press it into a rough circle, working from the center of the dough to the edge. The goal is to push all of the air to the edges or the crust of the pizza. Do not press the edge of the dough if you wish to have a puffy crust.</li>
            <li>Place the dough on to a oiled baking sheet and top it with the desired sauce and toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza until the dough is set and it begins to brown along the edge of the crust. This will take about 8 to 12 minutes. Make sure to watch your pizza while it is cooking to keep track of the cooking progress.</li>
            <p>NOTE: The total baking time will be determined by how crispy or soft you want the pizza. At minimum, cook until the edges are golden brown, but you can let it cook until there is browning of the cheese and a dark brown crust.</p>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer it onto the cutting board. Let the pizza cool slightly before cutting with your desired tool. The easiest option would be to use a pizza wheel, but scissors or knives will suffice.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
