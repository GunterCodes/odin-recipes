          <p>Pizza is the quintessential weekend meal - quick, cheap, and delicious. There is no need to go out and pay an overinflated amount of money for something that can be made with ingredients you probably have lying around your pantry.</p>
          <p>This recipe requires very little dough-know-how and energy to create. The most challenging step is mixing the dough (and even that is pretty easy!).</p>
          <p>For this recipe, you will need the following items/tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Bowl</li>
            <li>Scale or Measuring Cups/Spoons</li>
            <li>Wooden Spoon</li>
            <li>Plastic Wrap or Cloth Towel</li>
          </ul>
