          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the tools listed above, you will need the following ingredients for this recipe:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup (230g) Softened Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) Light or Dark Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>2 Whole Large Eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Molasses</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (188g) All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>3 cups (240g) Old-fashioned Rolled Oats</li>
            <li>1 cup (140g) Raisins</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Into a bowl, combine the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Using your mixer (or whisk) cream the butter and sugars together until smooth (~2 minutes). Add the eggs, molasses, and vanilla to the butter and sugar mixture and combine.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and mix on low (or stir) to combine. Once combined, add in the oats and raisins and combine. Place the dough in the fridge for 30 to 60 minutes to set.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (177C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or a silpat if you have it. If not, lightly grease the base of the pan with some butter.</li>
            <li>Take the chilled dough out of the oven and start scooping the dough into balls (~2 tbsp per cookie) and place them 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until lightly browned on the edges. The center will appear under-baked, but the cookie will continue cooking once out of the oven. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool (~5 minutes).</li>
            <p>NOTE: The size of the dough balls is up to you, if you want a large cookie, feel free to up the size. The bake time will change, but keep an eye on the color!</p>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
