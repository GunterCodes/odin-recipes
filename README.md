# odin-recipes
Welcome to my The Odin Project: Recipes project.
This project serves as the culmination of a few lessons of HTML modules. The goal of this project is to create a basic recipe website. The code that follows will be a HTML framework. Upon learning CSS and JS technologies, this site will become more interactive and attractive to the user.

This README.md was written on Oct. 10th, 2022. At this time, I am merely a novice coder. One day, I will become great at what I do.
